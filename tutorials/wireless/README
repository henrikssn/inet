INET Wireless Tutorial
======================

The INET Wireless Tutorial contains a series of simulation models numbered 
1 through 16. The models are of increasing complexity -- they start from the 
basics and introduce new INET features and concepts related to wireless 
communication networks.

Each model is self-contained, with its number in the file names, so e.g.
Wireless03.ned contains all the necessary NED definitions. (The omnetpp.ini 
file is shared among all simulation steps). It is recommended read the 
comments of the corresponding NED file first to understand what the
given step is supposed to demonstrate.
